# Protocol Design Module

## Overview
The Protocol Design module is a comprehensive tool for creating clinical trial protocols with a wizard-style interface. It guides pharmaceutical companies and researchers through the process of designing protocols for new drugs ready for human testing. The module features advanced AI capabilities that can generate complete protocol templates based on minimal input, dramatically reducing the time required to create regulatory-compliant protocols.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Protocol Generation**: Create complete protocol templates with just basic condition, therapeutic area, and phase information
- **Multi-step Wizard**: Guide users through the protocol creation process with a clear progression path
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators show completion status of each step
- **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions for therapeutic areas, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and endpoints
- **Compliance Checks**: Automated validation against regulatory guidelines (ICH, FDA, EMA)
- **Team Collaboration**: Assign team members to specific roles with defined responsibilities
- **Protocol Generation**: Create downloadable protocol documents ready for submission

## AI Integration
The Protocol Design module leverages AI to:

1. **Condition Analysis**: Automatically suggest therapeutic areas based on the condition being studied
2. **Complete Protocol Generation**: Generate comprehensive protocol templates with appropriate:
   - Study designs based on therapeutic area and phase
   - Inclusion/exclusion criteria tailored to the condition
   - Primary and secondary endpoints with appropriate timeframes
   - Assessment schedules and methodologies
3. **Compliance Validation**: Check protocols against regulatory standards and guidelines
4. **Smart Recommendations**: Provide template recommendations based on similar studies

## Components

### Page Component
- **ProtocolDesign.js**: Main container component that manages the wizard flow and state, including AI-generated protocol handling

### Form Components
1. **TrialBasicsForm.js**: First step for capturing essential trial information
   - Phase selection (Phase 1-4)
   - Therapeutic area with AI-suggestions
   - Drug name
   - Trial objectives
   - **Auto-Generate Protocol button** for AI-driven protocol creation

2. **StudyDesignForm.js**: Second step for defining study methodology
   - Study design type (randomized, open-label, etc.)
   - Population criteria (age range, inclusion/exclusion)
   - Intervention details (dosage, frequency, route)
   - Comparator selection

3. **EndpointsForm.js**: Third step for defining outcome measurements
   - Primary endpoints with type and timeframe
   - Secondary endpoints
   - Assessment methods and schedules

4. **TeamAssignmentForm.js**: Fourth step for assigning team members
   - Role assignment (PI, coordinator, etc.)
   - Responsibilities definition
   - External collaborator management

5. **ReviewForm.js**: Final step for reviewing and generating the protocol
   - Section-by-section review
   - Compliance validation
   - Protocol document generation

## AI Service Components
- **aiProtocolService.js**: Core service providing AI-powered protocol generation and recommendations
  - Therapeutic area classification based on condition
  - Complete protocol template generation
  - Compliance checking
  - Endpoint and criteria recommendations

## Usage Workflows

### Standard Workflow
1. Navigate to the Protocol Design module
2. Complete each step of the wizard manually, providing required information
3. Review the complete protocol in the final step
4. Generate and download the protocol document

### AI-Accelerated Workflow
1. Navigate to the Protocol Design module
2. Enter the condition, therapeutic area, and phase
3. Click "Auto-Generate Protocol" to have AI create a complete template
4. Review and modify the AI-generated content in each section
5. Generate and download the final protocol document

## Technical Implementation
- Built with React and Material-UI components
- Form state management with React hooks
- Responsive design for all device types
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- Mock AI service layer with realistic template generation (ready for real AI integration)

## Getting Started
To access the Protocol Design feature:
1. Log in to the platform
2. Navigate to Products > Protocol Design
3. Begin with basic trial information or use the AI generation feature
4. Follow the steps to complete your protocol

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real AI models for even more accurate protocol generation
- Direct submission to regulatory platforms
- Integration with clinical trial management systems
- Collaborative editing with version control
- Template library for faster protocol creation
- Machine learning that improves recommendations based on user feedback
